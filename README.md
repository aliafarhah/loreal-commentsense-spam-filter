# L'Oréal CommentSense: AI Spam Filter

## 🎯 Project Overview
An AI-powered solution to automatically detect and filter spam comments from L'Oréal's social media campaigns. This tool helps calculate a true Share of Engagement (SoE) metric by providing an accurate ratio of quality comments.

## 🚀 How It Works
The system uses intelligent pattern recognition to identify spam based on:
- URLs and suspicious links
- Follow-for-follow requests (@mentions with "follow me")
- Promotional and financial scam content
- Excessive emoji use
- Generic, low-effort comments

## 📁 Project Files
- `Loreal_Spam_Detector.ipynb` - Main Google Colab notebook with data processing and AI model
- `app.py` - Interactive Streamlit web application for demonstration

## ▶️ How to Run
1.  Open `Loreal_Spam_Detector.ipynb` in Google Colab
2.  Run all cells to process the dataset and train the model
3.  Launch the demo app with: `!streamlit run app.py`
